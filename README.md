# Fujifilm Camera Profiles

This is a set of camera profiles for use with raw images from digital cameras. They are based on the camera matching profiles available in adobe cameraraw / lightroom for fuji X-cameras. This latest version is based on a more recent camera model: the x-pro3.

The Film Looks are:
* Provia
* Velvia
* Astia
* Classic Chrome
* Pro neg std
* Pro neg hi
* Eterna
* Classic Neg

## New: Conversion luts for Classic Neg, Bleach Bypass, and Nostalgic Neg
These luts will convert images processed with Provia to the classic neg, bleach bypass, or nostalgic neg film simulations. They can be used with non fuji cameras using the the dng tables provided here, or with fuji x-trans cameras that don't come with these profiles using the Provia camera matching profile. They can also be applied directly to camera jpegs. The .cube files can be found in `provia conversion luts/` and are provided in both DisplayP3 and sRGB.

## Usage
Included for each profile are:
* text file containing the xml LookTable and ToneCurve for dcp profiles
* cube luts (3d rgb look-up-table)
  * .cube in both DisplayP3 and sRGB
  * .png CLUT in sRGB
* xml and dcp profiles as examples

For more details on editing profiles and making a linear profile for use with the luts, see my blog post [Making Linear Camera Profiles with dcpTool](https://abpy.github.io/2023/05/20/linear-profiles.html)

The cube LUTs are intended to be applied to an image with linear contrast. A linear camera profile is required for a correct result. See below for details

The Classic Neg profile is only available as a cube lut.

#### dcp camera profile
The dcp profiles use a LookTable and ToneCurve.

To make a profile, use [dcptool](https://dcptool.sourceforge.net/Introduction.html) to convert between xml and dcp.

To make a profile for your camera:
* find an existing dcp profile for that camera. ex. Adobe Standard
* convert it to xml
* replace the `<LookTable>` and `<ToneCurve>` xml tags with the ones from the film look text file
* set `<DefaultBlackRender>` to `1`
* set `<ProfileLookTableEncoding>` to `1`
* change `<ProfileName>`
* convert back to dcp

#### Using the cube luts, including "Classic Neg", in CameraRaw / Lightroom
You will need a [linear camera profile](https://abpy.github.io/2023/05/20/linear-profiles.html)
* Open an image with default settings (everything at 0, white balance: 'As Shot')
* Select the linear camera profile
* Option/Alt click the new preset button
* Change the profile name
* Select the Color Lookup Table checkbox
* Choose the cube file
* Set Space to Display P3
* Set Amount Min and Max to 100
